  "Amusement Park Problem><br><br>  The smell of popcorn was in the air. I could hear kids laughing and screaming. People were everywhere! The breeze felt warm on my skin. It was a perfect day at the amusement park. My family and I wandered around the park, getting snacks and going on rides . I loved almost all types of rides! I loved to go fast and to spin around, to go down hills and to get splashed. The only rides I didn’t like were rides that turn you upsidedown. My little brother, Ben, didn’t like those either, but my older sister, Laur a, loved them. When we finally were near a ride that went upsidedown, she started asking me to go with her. I told her I don’t like those rides, but she kept asking. Then she started whining because she didn’t want to go alone. I was feeling sympathy for her, so I started thinking that maybe I should go with her, even though I really don’t like to go upsidedown. I looked to my parents for help.",
  "Max's good Habit <br><br>  Max reads more than anyone he knows. He loves to read during all of his free time. His friends tease him because he would rather read than play video games, but his parents and his teachers are proud of him. They say reading is important, and it will help him learn about the world around him. They also tell him it is a good habit to read on a regular basis. One day Max was reading a magazine article about volcanoes. He told his friends all about volcanoes and what causes them to erupt. The very next week, his class was assigned a science project about volcanoes. Guess who everyone wanted in their project group? Max’s friends weren’t teasing him anymore. Max ended up being in a group with Liz, Anna and Josh. The assignment was to create a poster board with volcanoes and to build a volcano model. information about Max made copies of the magazine article about volcanoes so his project partners could read about them too. They also went to the library to look for more information about volcanoes.",
  "Anna and Her Basketball Adventure <br><br>  A group of teenage boys was playing basketball on the court at the park. The basketball court didn’t have a fence around it. If one of the boys missed the basket, someone had to catch the basketball quickly so it wouldn’t bounce too far away. One of the boys was showing off, and he tossed the ball with all of his strength from the one end of the co urt toward the basket on the other end. The ball was flying like a rocket over the heads of all of the other boys. Then it kept right on flying. It flew straight over the basket and out into the field. Anna was sitting at the end of the field near the pon d watching the ducks swim. She heard some yelling and turned to see a big orange object headed her way. The yelling was coming from the teenage boys. “Stop the ball,” one of them shouted.",
  "Hats in Harvard <br><br> Whoosh! Then answer each question. Hats in Harvard The cold wind roared through the trees and between buildings. Winter was on its way. Amaya was warm i n her house, thinking about an article she’d read at school. The article had been about kids who helped out their communities, and she thought i t would be really cool to help her own town, Harvard. The only problem was that she wasn’t sure how to help. What did her town need that a kid could do? In the article, the kids had grown food for people who needed food, but it was winter. She couldn’t start a gard en. Amaya was still deep in thought when her mom said it was time to go grocery shopping. As they drove along the road, Amaya saw a family walking on the sidewalk, wearing only light jackets. must be How cold they , Amaya thought. That gave her an idea! She could help her town, she could collect winter coats, hats, and gloves for people in Harvard who needed them. She shared her idea with her mom, who thought it was a great idea. But how would they spread the word so that they could get a lot of winter clothing? Amaya decided to talk to her teacher, because then she could share her idea with her classmates at least. Mrs. Monroe was very supportive when Amaya talked about her idea. She even said she could help Amaya talk to the principal about it, so they could get the whole school i nvolved! They decided to call the project “Hats in Harvard,” and they wrote up a letter explaining the idea to the families. Mrs. Monroe said they could even have the third graders take a field trip to parks around Harvard where families in need gathered to drop off the coats, hats, and gloves. Amaya was excited, and really hoped the principal, Mrs. Brown, would let the school participate! Amaya and Mrs. Monroe met with the principal one day during lunch time. Mrs. Brown was thrilled with the idea, and said she would make sure copies of the letter went home with all the students! They collected the winter clothing for a few weeks, then were able to take their field trip to two parks in th e area to leave the clothes where families who needed them could get them. Three days after their field trip, Amaya and her mom were once again driving together. She saw the same family walking together that had given her the idea for Hats in Harvard. Th i s time, though, the family looked nice and warm i n some new coats, hats, and gloves. Amaya felt a warm glow in her heart, and was very glad she could help her community",
  "Helping Hally <br><br> Sam was sitting on the couch, watching television. His mom walked in the door with Hally, their dog. Hally over to Sam and licked him hello. “Hi Hally! How was your checkup?” Sam asked. Hally just looked at Sam. “We have to help Hally,” said Mom. walked right “Help her how?” asked Sam. “Do you remember when we went to pick up Hally from her litter? We picke d her because she looked like her mom. She i s brown with spots, with long ears, and she was energetic, so we thought she’d be strong, like her mom. But how does she look now?” Mom asked. “Well,” thought Sam, “She’s still brown with spots and long ears, but she’s not very energetic or strong anymore.” “That’s what the vet said, too. We haven’t been letting her exercise as much, and we’ve been feeding her a lot. She would probably look just like her mom now if we had walked her more. We have to start walking her more often, so that she’ll stay healthy for a long time. Will you help?” “Sure!” said Sam. He decided that he could play fetch with her every day in the yard, because then she could run and run and run until she was tired. The first day, they o nly played fetch for about 10 minutes before Hally was tired. But Sam kept playing with her every day. Soon, they could play for an entire half an hour! Hally looked stronger every day, just like her mom. Sam felt great about helping Hally get strong again .",
  "My New Schooter <br><br> It was amazing. I couldn’t keep my eyes off it. The way it shone in the light kept drawing my eye back to it. My dad noticed. “Sophie, you have a scooter already, a really nice one!” “I know, but look at this one! It’s so shiny and new,” I said. “It is great, but we have to get going. Come on,” said Dad. We left the store, with me taking one last glance back at the new s cooter. I knew my scooter was nice, and it still worked even though I’d gotten it for my birthday 3 years ago. I just couldn’t stop thinking of that new scooter! A few weeks later, Dad and I were back in the store. The scooter wasn’t on display where it w as before, but as we passed the toy section, I kept my eyes open for it. There it was, with a big sale sign on it! I couldn’t help myself, I ran right over to it. Dad looked at the price. “I know you’ve been thinking about this scooter a lot, Sophie, and you haven’t asked for much from me or mom l ately. You’ve been helpful around the house, too. The sale price is pretty good, though it’s still a lot of money. I can’t just buy this for you, but what if I pay for part of it, then lend you the money for the r est of the scooter, and you promise to pay me back?” Dad asked. “Would you really?” I said excitedly. “I promise I will pay you back, I will!” “Sure, let’s get it,” said Dad as he picked up the box. As we were walking toward the registers, Dad asked me if knew what it meant to borrow money. “Yes, it means that I have to give it back to you,” I answered. I Dad responded, “You’re right, but you can give it back to me a little at a time. Right now you get five dollars a week for your allowance. Instead of usin g it for a little treat, you could pay it back to me until you pay off your part of the scooter. It will take a couple of months for you to be done paying me back for it if you do that. Does that work for you?” “Sure, Dad! Thank you so much, I can’t wait t o use my new scooter! I will pay you back with my allowance until I return all the money I’m borrowing from you today. You’re the best!”",
  "The Solver <br><br> Kevin loves to read mystery books. He reads mystery books because he likes to try to solve the mystery himself before he gets to the end. Solving puzzles is like solving mysteries, so he likes working on puzzles too. He also likes solving problems. Kevin can usually solve any mystery, puzzle or problem. One day Kevin’s mom was trying to find her glasses. Without her glasses, she could not drive. This was a problem because she was going to drive Kevin to his friend’s house. It was also a mystery and a puzzle. Kevin really wanted to solve this mystery. Kevin sat down with his mom. “Where do you last remember seeing your glass es?” he asked. “I had them on while I was watching the news this morning,” she said. “Where were you watching the news?” asked Kevin. His mom thought for a minute, and then she answered that she was in the family room. She remembered sitting in her favori te chair and taking off her glasses when the news ended. She thought she placed her glasses on the table, but they weren’t there. “Are you sure you didn’t put them on again after the morning news?” asked Kevin. “Maybe I did,” his mom replied. “Let’s walk t hrough your day, Mom,” said Kevin. Kevin had his mom describe everything she remembered doing during the day so far. She mentioned watching the news, making breakfast, folding laundry, working in her home office and then gardening. It was after gardening that she started looking for her glasses. After hearing about his mom’s day, Kevin retraced her path through the house and yard. He looked under the cushion of her favorite chair, in the kitchen, in the laundry basket, in her office and around the garden. He didn’t find her glasses. Kevin doesn’t give up easily though so he looked in each place again and he looked even harder. It was on his second go around of the kitchen that he thought to open the cabinets instead of just looking on the counters. Kevin so lved the mystery, the puzzle and the problem. He found his mom’s glasses in the drawer with the silverware. “Thank you, Kevin,” said his mom, “I wouldn’t be able to see anything without you.”",
  "Tag Rules! <br><br> “You’re it!” Nevaeh shouted as she tapped me on the arm. I spotted Raymond and charged after him. He veered to the right and I just missed him. Nevaeh was just past him, so I started chasing after her, but she shouted, “No tag backs!” “Yeah there are! We didn’t make rules for this tag game, so I can tag you!” I said, out of breath as I ran toward her. “Then I’m not playing anymore,” replied Nevaeh. And just like that, our tag game was over. annoying How , I thought. Raymond and I stopped to talk. “I guess this is one reason that people make rules for games,” said Raymond. “We could still be playing if we had agreed on the rules with Nevaeh before we played.” “I guess,” I said, “but rules are boring. I just want to play!” I decided to try playing with someo ne else, without rules. I played football and tackled Domingo, who hurt his arm. The other kids didn’t want to play football with me anymore. Next I went on the monkey bars, and went on before Amelia was to the end of the bars. She surprised me when she turned around and came back on the monkey bars, and we bumped into each other. She cried and told me that now she couldn’t break her monkey bar record. I was by myself again. “Maybe there is a reason we have rules,” I said to myself as I walked back over b y Raymond, who was on the slide. If I would have used rules, Nevaeh would feel like the tag game was fair, so she would still be playing with me. If I had played by the rules and done touch football with the other players, Domingo would not have gotten hur t, and the other kids would still be playing with me. And if I had waited my turn on the monkey bars, Amelia would not be mad at me and could have broken her record, then I could have had my turn. “Raymond, you’re right, rules are important. They help keep things fair, safe, and fun for everyone. Let’s go talk with Nevaeh about some fair rules for tag.” And off we went",
  "Amanda's News <br><br> It was a long week for Amanda at school. She stayed after school to work on a special project three days in a row. When she got home on Friday, she plopped down in her favorite chair with a sigh. “What’s going on, Amanda?” her dad asked as he was reading the newspaper. “I have to create a webpage for my technology class, and it is taking a lot m ore time than I thought it would,” Amanda answered. Her dad looked over his newspaper and said, “When I was your age, we didn’t even have computers, let alone the internet.” He folded his newspaper and asked Amanda what the webpage is about. “It’s about t he difference between newspaper news and i nternet news,” Amanda said and added,” I have to provide i nformation, examples and illustrations.” “Sounds tough; do you have someone to help you?” her dad asked. “I have a partner named Zach,” Amanda replied. “We did research on the internet today and found some pictures to use.” “You are lucky you have the internet for research,” her dad said. “Back in my day, we had to do all of our research at the library and look through books, newspapers and magazines.” He the n asked, “What is the difference between newspaper news and internet news?” Amanda explained to her father the main differences: newspaper news is printed on paper, and internet news is published online; newspaper news is only available once a day, and int ernet news is published almost as soon as the news happens; many newspapers don’t even print a daily paper, and internet news is published around the clock. When Amanda and Zach finished their webpage, it had many examples which compared the times certain news stories were available to readers of newspapers and readers of internet news. It also had pictures of traditional newspaper headlines and internet news headlines. Amanda’s dad saw the webpage and thought it was very well done. He asked, “Which type of news do you like better?” I like internet news better because I like to learn about the news when it happens,” she answered. Her dad said, “I still like ne wspaper news better because I like to hold the paper in my hands and turn the pages.” Amanda plopped down on her chair again and said, “You are so old school, Dad.”© www.k5learning.com Reading and Math for K 5",
  "Will the Wolf <br><br> Will was fed up. All he wanted was to do things his way. Why did all the wolves have to do everything together anyway? They ate together, played together, slept together, and walked together. Everywhere. Everyday. It was exhausting. Will was growing up. He could do things himself now, and he had some pretty good ideas, too! But his mom wouldn’t l et him try his ideas by him self. Will didn’t get it. One day, the pack was walking through the woods. Will had an idea that there was food down a path, but the pack didn’t want to go that way. Finally, Will said, “Why do we need a pack anyway? I’m going to go down that path and I’l l have plenty to eat! I don’t need you guys!” The pack did not approve. They said, “Will, you can try going off on your own, but we need to work together in our pack. Packs help us survive.” Will didn’t believe them. He ran off on his own. He ran for mile s. He started to get tired, and it was getting dark. Usually, the pack would all find a spot together to sleep, but Will had no pack now. He decided to find a cave. When he settled down to sleep, Will though, “Sleeping would be much easier with my pack all around me. If something comes, I’d have them to protect me.” He barely slept that night. In the morning, he decided to go back. Will hoped he could find his pack again. He ran back to where they’d last been together. As he was running, he smelled a deer. “Hmmmm…” Will thought. “The pack would be impressed if I brought a deer for us all.” So he decided to hunt on his own. Quietly, he crept through the woods. He tracked the deer i nto a clearing. Will looked around. Where was the deer? Suddenly, something cha rged out of the trees at him! It was the deer, and those antlers were sharp!!! If his pack were here, they would help him, but Will was alone. He ran from the deer as fast as he could! After a while, the deer stopped chasing him. Will rested. He started t hinking how much easier this trip would have been with his pack by his side. He would have been able to sleep soundly. He would have been warmer with them all around him. He would have been able to take down the deer with his pack by his side. Now, Will wa s just hungry and lonely. He realized his pack had been right, packs do help them survive. Will knew that now, and was determined to find his pack and work hard to help them as much as they help him.",
  "What Are Clouds?(NF) <br><br> A cloud is made of water drops or ice crystals floating in the sky. There are many kinds of clouds. Clouds are an important part of Earth’s weather. How Do Clouds Form? <br>The sky can be full of water. But most of the time you can't see the water. The drops of water are too small to see. They have turned into a gas called water vapor. As the water vapor goes higher i n the sky, the air gets cooler. The cooler air causes the w ater droplets to start to stick to things like bits of dust, ice or sea salt. <br>What Are Some Types of Clouds?<br> Clouds get their names in two ways. One way is by where they are found in the sky. Some clouds are high up in the sky. Low clouds form closer to E arth's surface. In fact, low clouds can even touch the ground. These clouds are called fog. Middle clouds are found between low and high clouds Another way clouds are named is by their shape. Cirrus clouds are high clouds. They look like feathers. Cumulus clouds are middle clouds. These clouds look like giant cotton balls in the sky. Stratus clouds are low clouds. They cover the sky like bed sheets. <br>What Causes Rain? <br> Most of the water in clouds is in very small droplets. The droplets are so light they flo at in the air. Sometimes those droplets join with other droplets. Then they turn into larger drops. When that happens, gravity causes them to fall to Earth. We call the falling water drops “rain”. When the air is colder, the water may form snowflakes inste ad. Freezing rain, sleet or even hail can fall from clouds. <br>Why Does NASA Study Clouds?<br> Clouds are important for many reasons. Rain and snow are two of those reasons. At night, clouds reflect heat and keep the ground warmer. During the day, clouds make sha de that can keep us cooler. Studying clouds helps NASA better understand Earth's weather. NASA uses satellites in space to study clouds. NASA also studies clouds on other planets. Mars has clouds that are like the clouds on Earth. But other planets have c louds that aren't made of water. For example, Jupiter has clouds made of a gas called ammonia.",
  "Landforms(NF) <br><br> There are many different types of landforms. Landforms are natural features on the planet’s surface. You probably know about some of them already! Mountains are very tall landforms. They can be pointed or rounded, and some are even volcanic! When there are many mountains together, it is called a mountain range. Some mountains are formed from lava, while other mountains are formed when the plates under the earth’s surface crash together and push up the land. Either way mountains are formed, it takes many, many years.  Valleys are the spaces between mountains. Some valleys are V-shaped, and some are U-shaped. Many people live in valleys, because they have a comfortable temperature, are protected, and may have rivers flowing through them. Plateaus are like mountains, but instead of pointed or rounded tops, they are flat on top. They usually form when magma rises, but doesn’t break through the surface. The l and rises instead. Plains are large, flat areas of land. Since flat land is easy to build on, many cities are on plains. Many plants can grow on plains, as well. Some plains are by oceans, and are called ocean plains. Plains that are by rivers are called river plains, and are especially good for growing crops. Islands are areas of land su They can be formed by underwater volcanoes. The rrounded by water on all sides. l ava builds up over time and eventually breaks the surface of the ocean. Deserts are another type of landform. They are large areas of land that do not receive a lot of rainfal l . They can be very hot during the day, and very cold at night. It is difficult for many plants and animals to live in deserts. What kind of landform would you like to live on?",
  "How to Make Ice Cream (NF) <br><br> Do you like ice cream? Maybe you always buy it at the store or from an ice cream shop, but did you know you can make your own ice cream at home? First, gather your materials. You will need milk, sugar, and vanilla as the ingredients for the ice cream. Yo u will also need some other materials to turn those ingredients into ice cream. The other materials are two zip and salt. One of the zip-- top plastic bags, ice, top plastic bags should be larger than the other. You might also want winter gloves or a towel t o use later on! In the smaller bag, combine 1 cup of milk, about 2 tablespoons of sugar, and ½ teaspoon of vanilla. Close the top up tightly! Use your hands to squish the bag to mix the ingredients, or shake the bag. In the larger bag, combine between 2 cups of ice and about ⅓ cup of salt. Put the smaller bag into the larger bag, making sure the small bag is still closed tightly. Close the larger bag. If you want to keep your hands warm, put on the winter gloves or wrap the larger bag in a towel. Shake th e bags for at least 5 minutes. Take a peek at the smaller bag to see if it looks like i ce cream, or if it’s still liquid. If it looks like ice cream, then you can take the smaller bag out of the larger one, pour the ice cream into a bowl, and enjoy your tr eat! If it still looks thin, shake the bag for a few more minutes before enjoying. When you feel successful at making plain vanilla ice cream, experiment with adding different ingredients to make your own delicious flavors!",
  "The Life Cycle (NF)<br><br> When you plant a seed, does it stay a seed forever? No! Plants and animals grow and change throughout their lives. Many plants begin as seeds. As the seed gets what it needs (water, sunlight, and nutrients from the soil), it begins to grow. The seed turns into a little sprout. It keeps growing until it is a fullgrown plant. Then the plant makes new seeds, so that new plants can grow even after the plant grows old and dies. Those seeds will then go through their growth process. Because seeds go through this process over and over again, it is called a life cycle. Animals also have life cycles. A frog begins as an egg. W hen the egg hatches, it turns into a tadpole. The tadpoles grow legs and arms, and eventually grow into adult frogs. The adult frogs l ay eggs, so that new frogs can live even after the frog grows old and dies A dog’s life cycle is a little different than a frog’s, because a dog does not start out as an egg. It is born from its mother’s belly. The puppy keeps growing and is eventually an adult dog. Then the adult dog might have puppies to continue the life cycle! Insects like caterpillars go through life cy cles, too. Caterpillars begin as eggs. When they hatch, they are larva. The caterpillar becomes a pupa, and inside of the pupa it turns into an adult. The adult is not a caterpillar; it is a butterfly! Then the butterfly lays eggs, so that new caterpillars and butterflies can live even after the butterfly grows old and dies. Plants and animals don’t stay the same throughout their lives, they grow and change through their life cycle.",
  "Force (NF) <br><br> Imagine you’re going bowling. You roll the ball down the lane, and it hits a bowling pin. The bowling pin stays up. Is that what you would expect to happen? Probably not, because the bowling ball exerted force on the bowling pin, so it should have been knocked over! Force is the push or pull upon an object. Since the bowling ball moves and hits the bowling pin, the force causes bowling pin to move, too. the Is force at work in other sports? Yes, it is! Think about baseball. The ball could not fly out of the stadium by itself. The pitcher uses the force of his or her arm to make the ball go. The batter uses force to make the bat ball will move towards the outfield. hit the ball, so the What about football? The same force the pitchers use in baseball works in football, too. The ball cannot move by i tself, the quarterback has to use force to throw the ball to another player. Here’s a different situation: what happens when two football players who have the same strength go to block each other? They have the same strength and so they might have the same force on the other player. What happens if two objects that have the same force tr opposite sides? Nothing! They players would stay in the same spot, trying to force the other, until the referee blows the whistle. Force is not just at work in sports, either. You can experiment with force right now! Get a block. Use one hand y to push from to exert force on the block by pushing it along the surface of a table (not too hard, you don’t want to break anything!). What happens? The force makes the block slide. Now try putting one hand on each side of the block and push your hands together. D oes the block move? Probably not, since you are probably exerting the same amount of force on each side of the block. If there is more force on one side of an object, it will move. If there is the same amount of force on all sides of the object, it will st force!",
  "Healthy Muscles Matter (NF) <br><br> Did you know you have more than 600 muscles in your body? These muscles help you move, lift things, pump blood through your body, and even help you breathe.  When you think about your muscles, you probably think most about the ones you can control. These are your voluntary muscles, which means you can control their movements. They are also called skeletal muscles, because they attach to your bones and work together with your bones to help you walk, run, pick up things, play an instrument, throw a baseball, kick a soccer ball, push a lawnmower, or ride a bicycle. The muscles of your mouth and throat even help you talk!  Keeping your muscles healthy will help you to be able to walk, run, jump, lift things, play sports, and do all the other things you love to do. Exercising, getting enough rest, and eating a balanced diet will help to keep your muscles healthy for life.<br>W hy healthy muscles matter to you<br> Healthy muscles let you move freely and keep your body strong. Healthy muscles let you move freely and keep your body strong. They help you to enjoy playing sports, dancing, walking the dog, swimming, and other fun activiti they help you do those other (not so fun) things that you have to do, like making the bed, vacuuming the carpet, or es. And mowing the lawn. Strong muscles also help to keep your joints in good shape. If the muscles around your knee, for example, get weak, you may be more likely to injure that knee. Strong muscles also help you keep your balance, so you are less likely to slip or fall. And remember — the activities that make your skeletal muscles strong will also help to keep your heart muscle strong! Differe nt kinds of muscles have different jobs Skeletal muscles are connected to your bones by tough cords of tissue called tendons. As the muscle contracts, it pulls on the tendon, which moves the bone. Bones are connected to other bones by ligaments muhnts), (LIGuhwhich are like tendons and help hold your skeleton together. Smooth muscles are also called involuntary muscles since you have no control over them. Smooth muscles work in your digestive system to move food along and push waste out of you r body. They also help keep your eyes focused without your having to think about it. Cardiac (KARdeeak) muscle. Did you know your heart is also a muscle? It is a specialized type of involuntary muscle. It pumps blood through your body, changing its speed keep up with the demands you put on it. It pumps more slowly when you’re sitting or lying down, and faster when you’re running or playing sports and your skeletal muscles need more blood to help them do their work.",
  "The Bee (NF) <br><br> Bees live in a house that is called a hive. There are three kinds of bees: workers, drones, and queens.  Only one queen bee can live in each hive. If she is lost or dead, the other bees will stop their work. Bees are very wise and busy little creatures. They all join together to build cells of wax for their honey.  Each bee takes its proper place and does its own work. Some go out and gather honey from the flowers; others stay at home and work inside the hive. The cells which they build are all of one shape and size, and no room is left between them.  The cells are not round. They have six sides. Did you ever look into a glass hive to see the bees while at work? It is pleasant to see how busy they always are. But the drones do not work. Before winter comes, all the drones are driven from the hive so that they don’t eat the honey which they did not gather. It is not safe for chi l dren to handle bees. Bees have a painful sting that they use in their defense."
